# ncsu-fall16-csc505

This repository holds code I wrote for CSC 505 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) with by Dr. David Sturgill at [NC State University](https://ncsu.edu) in Fall 2016.

## Course Description

_Algorithm design techniques: use of data structures, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy techniques, local and global search. Complexity and analysis of algorithms: asymptotic analysis, worst case and average case, recurrences, lower bounds, NP-completeness. Algorithms for classical problems including sorting, searching and graph problems [connectivity, shortest paths, minimum spanning trees]._

## Citation Notes

* The included problem statements were not written by me, they are taken from the assignment descriptions given in class.
* Any references to "our textbook" are to [Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms).
