# CSC505: Design and Analysis of Algorithms

This repository will hold some code written for CSC505 taught by Dr. David Sturgill at NC State University in Fall 2016. The included problem statements were not written by me, they are taken from the assignment descriptions.

## Citation Notes

* The included problem statements were not written by me, they are taken from the assignment descriptions given in class.
* Any references to "our textbook" are to Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.
